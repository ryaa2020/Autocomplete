# Autocomplete

## Description

For this project, we implemented a program which autocompletes phrases. After you type a phrase, common words and phrases beginning with what you typed will appear, allowing you to save time by selecting a suggested term.

This autocomplete will only display a limited number of completions. Otherwise, the user would see an unmanageable number of possibilities and the autocomplete would be more confusing than useful.
